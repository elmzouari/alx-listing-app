# Wireframing Project

This repository contains the wireframes for a vacation rental booking application. The goal of this project is to visualize and prototype the user interface and user experience before moving into the development phase.

## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes are a crucial part of the user experience (UX) and interface design process. They serve as visual guides that represent the skeletal framework of a digital product. Wireframes typically come in two forms: **low-fidelity** and **high-fidelity**.

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes

Low-fidelity wireframes are basic sketches or layouts used in the early stages of design. They help teams quickly explore ideas and map out user flows without getting distracted by visual details.

- **When to Use:**
  - In the early design phase to brainstorm and iterate quickly.
  - To test layout structure and user flow with stakeholders.
  - For internal discussion on functionality and content hierarchy.

- **Characteristics:**
  - Simplified design using grayscale elements.
  - Placeholder text and images.
  - Often hand-drawn or created with basic shapes.

### High-Fidelity Wireframes

High-fidelity wireframes are polished and detailed designs that closely resemble the final product. These are used in the later stages of the design process to validate interactions, visual design, and content placement.

- **When to Use:**
  - In the later design phase for presentation or stakeholder approval.
  - During usability testing with end users.
  - Before handoff to development teams.

- **Characteristics:**
  - Includes branding, color schemes, typography, and images.
  - Reflects final layout and design specifications.
  - Allows interaction simulation through clickable prototypes.

## Wireframe Type in This Project

The wireframes in this project are **high-fidelity wireframes**. They are designed to demonstrate detailed visual layouts, user interactions, and navigation flows for a vacation rental booking app.

These wireframes include:
- Color and branding elements.
- Styled UI components (buttons, forms, cards, etc.).
- Realistic content and image placements.
- Screens for sign-in, sign-up, home feed, property details, booking process, and review order.

These high-fidelity wireframes help communicate the final design vision to developers, stakeholders, and users for feedback and testing.
