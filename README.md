## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes are an essential part of the design process, offering a blueprint for the layout and functionality of a website or app. There are two main types of wireframes:

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
Low-fidelity wireframes are simple, basic sketches that represent the layout of the page without detailed visual elements. They are typically used in the early stages of the design process to explore ideas, focus on structure, and quickly iterate on concepts.

**When to use:**
- Early design phases, to quickly convey ideas.
- Exploration of layout and structure without focusing on visuals.
- Testing the flow and functionality of a page or app.

**Characteristics:**
- Simple, often hand-drawn or using basic shapes.
- Lacks detail, such as colors, images, and fonts.
- Focuses primarily on layout and content hierarchy.

### High-Fidelity Wireframes
High-fidelity wireframes are more detailed and accurate representations of the final design. They include precise layouts, colors, fonts, and sometimes images, and they are closer to what the final product will look like.

**When to use:**
- Later stages of the design process, to refine the user interface.
- Creating prototypes for user testing or presentations.
- Finalizing visual design before moving to development.

**Characteristics:**
- Detailed with elements like colors, typography, and images.
- Designed to closely resemble the final product.
- Used for testing user experience with a higher level of visual fidelity.
