# Wireframing

## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes are blueprints for user interfaces that help visualize layout and functionality before development begins. They are generally categorized into two types:

### 1. Low-Fidelity Wireframes
These are basic sketches or outlines that focus on the layout, structure, and flow of a page without detailed design elements. They are quick to create and are used early in the design process.

**Characteristics:**
- Simple shapes and placeholders
- No colors, images, or fonts
- Focus on layout and user flow

**Use Cases:**
- Brainstorming sessions
- Gathering initial feedback
- Internal team discussions

### 2. High-Fidelity Wireframes
These wireframes are more detailed and visually closer to the final design. They may include specific fonts, colors, icons, and sometimes interactive elements.

**Characteristics:**
- Detailed visuals
- Often created using design software
- Simulates the final product's appearance

**Use Cases:**
- Stakeholder presentations
- High-fidelity user testing
- Final sign-off before development

## Wireframe Type Used

The wireframe in this project is a **low-fidelity wireframe**. It was designed to map out the structure and functionality of the user interface without focusing on aesthetic details. This approach allowed for rapid iteration and easy feedback before any visual design decisions were made.

## Wireframing in Practice

### Real-World Scenario:
During the planning phase of an e-commerce website, the design team used low-fidelity wireframes to map out the checkout flow. Initial wireframes revealed that users had to go through five different screens to complete a purchase. Usability testing on the wireframes showed that users felt the process was too long and confusing.

### Resolution:
Based on this feedback, the team redesigned the wireframe to consolidate steps and present progress in a clear step-by-step manner (e.g., a progress bar with 3 steps). This improved version was then turned into a high-fidelity wireframe and shared with developers.

### Impact on Final Product:
The final checkout experience was significantly improved. It reduced abandonment rates by 18% and increased overall customer satisfaction. These changes would have been much more expensive to make had they been identified after development started.

## Conclusion

Wireframing plays a crucial role in identifying usability issues early in the design process. It helps teams align on structure and functionality before investing time and resources into development. By allowing for feedback and iteration at a low cost, wireframing ensures that the final product is not only functional but also user-friendly.
